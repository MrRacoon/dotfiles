My Dot Files
============
```
I've gone through too many weird iterations with my dot files. I hope to once
and for all end this!
```

I'm hoping to start with my vimrc, which I dub as the most important df of all!

VimRC
-----
```
This is my editor. There are many like it but this one is mine. Without Vim, I 
am useless. Without me, Vim is useless.
```

The road before you, no matter your path, will require you to write bagillions
upon millions of lines of code. You're main weapon on this journey, will
undoubtedly be that of a good shell, and a good text editor.

Just like any other adventure, you start this journey will little more than a
bag of marbles and a Popsicle stick. But you will learn. Eventually sometime
down the road, you will learn to build upon, and modify, and hone your tools
into one single, utterly destructive force, that will rip the brittle fabric of
reality in two, impressing Thor himself.

You VimRC file is that which describes you ability to make persistent changes
in the world. You are defined by your ways, and this file is those ways.

This is where I will start, and may I never feel content with my editor.
